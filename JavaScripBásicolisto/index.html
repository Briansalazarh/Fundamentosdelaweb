            <h2 class="text"><strong>JavaScript Basics</strong></h2>
            <p class="parrafo">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is
                extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
                flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
                provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul class="lista">
                <li><span class="colorli">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing
                    data
                    values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
                    JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called
                    identifiers. <span class="color1">var x;</span></li>
                <li><span class="colorli">Variable Assignment</span> operators assign values to JavaScript variables -
                    our
                    cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
                    assigns a value to a variable. <span class="color1">var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><span class="colorli">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate
                    on
                    variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
                    Boolean - <span class="color1">true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span
                        class="color1">null</span>
                    aka nothing; Number - <span class="color1">42</span> or <span class="color1">3.14159;</span> String
                    -
                    <span class="color1">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="color1">[1, 'Coding', 2,
                        'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="color1">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li><span class="colorli">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions
                    for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been
                    met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: <span class="color1">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code
                    in
                    our code block; <span class="color1">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; <span class="color1">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><span class="colorli">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                    language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of
                    times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                    Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><span class="colorli">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call
                    our
                    function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine
                    we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first
                    we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
                    over again.</li>
